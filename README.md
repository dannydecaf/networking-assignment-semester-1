# Raspberry Pi Weather FM

Raspberry Pi Weather FM is a sensor-based playlist application that is internet-connect. Plays music depending on the current temperature. 'Hot Music' or 'Cold Music', so to speak.

# Overview

Applied concepts from 3 strands of modules learned in my Computer Science degree: Networking, Computer Programming, and Web Development. Temperature data is read in via sensor on the backend, and the website with a temperature-dependent YouTube playlist is rendered. Scope for further advancement for wider variety of songs and more.
